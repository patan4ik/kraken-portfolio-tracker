# Kraken Portfolio Tracker

A Python tool for tracking and analyzing your Kraken portfolio and ledger history.  
Generates CSV snapshots, computes trends, and builds daily reports of EUR spend per asset.

## Overview

Kraken Portfolio Tracker helps you monitor your cryptocurrency holdings and transaction history on Kraken.  
It supports real-time balance tracking, historical portfolio snapshots, and incremental ledger reporting.

## Features

### üìä Portfolio Tracking
- Fetch balances and prices from Kraken API
- Aggregate staked and available balances
- Save daily CSV snapshots (`portfolio_snapshots.csv`)
- Compute portfolio trends from historical data

### üìÅ Ledger Reporting
- Incrementally download and cache Kraken ledger (`raw-ledger.json`)
- Build daily EUR spend reports per asset (`ledger_eur_report.csv`)
- Efficient refid-based updates to avoid redundant API calls

### üß™ Developer Tools
- Fully unit-tested with `pytest`
- Code formatting with Black and linting with Ruff
- Pre-commit hooks for clean commits

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/kraken-portfolio-tracker.git
cd kraken-portfolio-tracker
python -m venv .venv
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass # bypass Windows policies for VM current session
.venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
deactivate    # deactivate VM in Windows
```

## API Key Setup

This project uses Kraken API keys stored in `kraken.key`.  
**Important:** Replace the placeholder values with your own credentials before running the app.

To use the Kraken API, create a file named `kraken.key` in the project root.  
You can start by copying the example file:

```bash
cp kraken.key.example kraken.key
```

Then replace the placeholder values with your actual API credentials:
```
API_KEY=your_key_here
API_SECRET=your_secret_here
```
Important: Never commit your real API keys to GitHub. This file is excluded via .gitignore.

## Git Hygiene

This project includes a `.gitignore` file to exclude:
- API keys (`kraken.key`)
- Build artifacts (`__pycache__`, `.pytest_cache`, `build/`)
- PyInstaller spec files (`*.spec`)

## Getting Started

Once installed and configured, run the tracker:

```
python balances.py
```
This will:
- Fetch current balances
- Save a snapshot
- Update your historical CSV log
- Load or update raw-ledger.json
- Generate ledger_eur_report.csv with daily EUR spend per asset

or schedule it via Task Scheduler (Windows) or cron (Linux) to log portfolio history daily.

## Running Tests

Run the unit tests:
```
pytest -v
```

## Code Style

This project uses Black and Ruff for consistent code style:
```bash
black . # automatically format your files before they are committed
ruff check . # catch code smells and unused imports before they hit production
```

Pre-commit hooks are configured ‚Äî enable them with:
```bash
pre-commit install # Since you‚Äôve already configured pre-commit hooks in .pre-commit-config.yaml, you can enable them locally. Now every time you run git commit, Black and Ruff will automatically check your files before they are committed ‚Äî so your CI will stay green without extra work.
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- Internet connection
- Kraken API credentials

See [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) for full dependency list.

## Building Executable (Windows)

To build a Windows `.exe` file from the source code:

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --onefile balances.py
```
The output will be in the dist/ folder.
